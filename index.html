        <h1>Everything You Need to Know about Press-On Nails</h1>

            <p>
                When people say press-ons, the first thing that comes to mind are the cheap plastic nails that can be found at Target, Wal-Mart, or Sally's Beauty Supply. 
                Here, we're talking about <strong>Luxury Press-Ons</strong>. Over the last few years, press-ons have started making a come-back, and it's becoming harder and harder 
                to tell which sets have been done at home and which were done in a salon. Press-on nails have been seen on the red carpet and at celebrity events worn by Cardi B, 
                Rihanna, Billie Eilish and more. <br><br>There are many benefits to wearing press-ons, but some of the main ones include:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Cost less</li>
                <li>No salon wait times</li>
                <li>Resuable</li>
                <li>Less damage to nails</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Whether you're just getting into the nail scene or been wearing them for years, press-on nails are definitely worth a try. They're perfect for a weekend event or, with proper care and maintance,
                can easily last three (3) to four (4) weeks. You can still find press-ons at your local beauty supply store, with much nicer finishings than back in the 90s and early 2000s, 
                but a new practice is to buy them from people online who make both custom and pre-made sets. They can be found in places like Amazon, Etsy, and even Instagram. Even more common, you can buy kits from Amazon and DIY them, as well.

        <h2>Shapes and Sizes</h2>

        <p>
            Any shape or size you can get at the salon, you can find in press-ons. Whether you need them short for the week but want them long for the weekend, you can mix and match or switch them up with ease. 
            The possibilities are endless. You can cut them down to make them small or extra small, you can glue them together to make extra long, and you can wear them all sizes in between. <br><br>
            Common Styles Include:
        </p>

        <h4>Coffin</h4>
        <p>Coffin nails, also known as ballerina nails because of their signature shape, are among the most popular nail shape for younger and older crowds. They're a classic trendy nail that looks good for a night out on the 
            town and still professional enough for the workplace. 
        </p>

        <h4>Stiletto</h4>
        <p>Stiletto nails are another popular nail shape, especially among the younger crowd. The longer they are the better they look, adding a bit of an edge to the style of the wearer. </p>

        <h4>Almond</h4>
        <p>Almond nails are for those who want a more natural looking nail shape. They help to elongate the nail while still having a feminine class feel to them, making them perfect for any occasion.</p>

        <h4>Square</h4>
        <p>Square nails have probably been around the longest, flat on top with a straight edge and pointed sides. Great for the workplace, any style paiirs well with this classic, low maitenance look.
            It should be noted that these nails are a bit wide, which is great for designs, but will add some width to the appearance of the fingers.
        </p>

        <h4>Oval</h4>
        <p>Oval nails are similiar to square, except that they round at the end which can help to elongate wider fingers. Some people tend to mix square and over nails, making them squoval, to get the best of both worlds.</p>

        <h4>Lipstick</h4>
        <p>Lipstick nails are among the newest nail trend, looking exactly like the sound. Smiliar to coffin or square nails, except the edge is cut diagonally instead of across. This shape is of the most dramatic, and while it may 
            not be the best for the workplace, it certainly adds flare to any style.
        </p>

       <p> The best style for you is the one you feel most comfortable with because when you feel good you look good, but you certainly can't go wrong with any of these.</p>
