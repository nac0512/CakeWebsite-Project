        <h1>Everything You Need to Know about Press-On Nails</h1>
        <hr>

            <p>
                When people say press-ons, the first thing that comes to mind are the cheap plastic nails that can be found at Target, Wal-Mart, or Sally's Beauty Supply. 
                Here, we're talking about <strong>Luxury Press-Ons</strong>. Over the last few years, press-ons have started making a come-back due to their convenience and ability to be dressed up or down, and it's becoming harder and harder 
                to tell which sets have been done at home and which were done in a salon. Press-on nails have even been seen at celebrity events worn by Cardi B, 
                Rihanna, Billie Eilish, and more. <br><br><strong>There are many benefits to wearing press-ons, but some of the main ones include:</strong>
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Cost less</li>
                <li>No salon wait times</li>
                <li>Resuable</li>
                <li>Less damage to nails</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Whether you're just getting into the nail scene or been wearing them for years, press-on nails are definitely worth a try. They're perfect for a weekend event or, with proper care and maintance,
                can easily last <ins>three (3) to four (4) weeks</ins>. You can still find press-ons at your local beauty supply store, with much nicer finishings than back in the 90s and early 2000s, 
                but a new practice is to buy them from people online who make both custom and pre-made sets. They can be found in places like Amazon, Etsy, and even Instagram. Even more common, you can buy kits from Amazon and DIY them, as well. 
            </p>

        <h2>Shapes and Sizes</h2>

            <p>
                Any shape or size you can get at the salon, you can find in press-ons. Whether you need them short for the week but want them long for the weekend, you can mix and match with ease. 
                You can cut them down to make them extra small, you can glue them together to make them extra long, and you can wear them all sizes in between. The possibilities are endless. <br><br>
                <strong>Common nail shapes include:</strong>
            </p>

            <h4>Coffin</h4>
            <p id="coffin" > </p><img src="images/coffin.png" alt="coffin nail shape outline" height="120" width="85" align="left"/> <br>
                <em>Coffin nails</em>, also known as ballerina nails because of their signature shape, are among the most popular nail shape for younger and older crowds. They're a classic trendy nail that looks good for a night out on the 
                town, yet is still professional enough for the workplace. 
            </p>

            <h4>Stiletto</h4>
            <p id="stiletto" >
                <img src="images/stiletto.png" alt="stiletto nail shape outline" height="120" width="85" align="left"/> <br>
                <em>Stiletto nails</em> are another popular nail shape, especially among the younger crowd. The longer they are the better they look, adding a bit of an edge to the style of the wearer. 
            </p>

            <h4>Almond</h4>
            <p id="almond" >
                <img src="images/almond.png" alt="almond nail shape outline" height="120" width="85" align="left"/> <br>
                <em>Almond nails</em> are for those who want a more natural looking nail shape. They help to elongate the nail while still having a feminine, classy feel to them, making them perfect for any occasion.
            </p>

            <h4>Square</h4>
            <p id="square" >
                <img src="images/square.png" alt="square nail shape outline" height="120" width="85" align="left"/> <br>
                <em>Square nails</em> have probably been around the longest, flat on top with a straight edge and pointed sides. Great for the workplace, any style pairs well with this classic, low maitenance look.
                It should be noted that these nails are a bit wide, which is great for designs, but will add some width to the appearance of the fingers.
            </p>

            <h4>Oval</h4>
            <p id="oval" >
                <img src="images/oval.png" alt="oval nail shape outline" height="120" width="85" align="left"/> <br>
                <em>Oval nails</em> are similiar to square, except that they round at the end which can help to elongate wider fingers. Some people tend to mix square and oval nails, making them squoval, to get the best of both worlds.
            </p>

            <h4>Lipstick</h4>
            <p id="lipstick" >
                <img src="images/lipstick.png" alt="lipstick nail shape outline" height="120" width="85" align="left"/> <br>
                <em>Lipstick nails</em> are among the newest nail trend, looking exactly like they sound. They are similiar to coffin or square nails, except the edge is cut diagonally instead of across. This shape is of the most dramatic, and while it may 
                not be the best for the workplace, it certainly adds flare to any style.
            </p>

            <p> The best shape for you is the one you feel most comfortable with because when you feel good you look good, but whatever you choose, you can't go wrong.</p>

        <h2>Styles and Designs</h2>

            <p> 
                Press-ons can be decorated as much or as little as you like. Whether you're a stickler for regular or gel nail polish, acrylic, or dip powder, you can continue to get 
                your nails styled however you like, often at salon quality or better. If you like them sweet and simple or loaded with gems, stickers, decals, or hand painted designs, press-ons can handle them all. <strong>Here are some 
                examples of all the different base types:</strong> 
            </p>

            <h4>Regular and Gel Polish</h4>

                someone will be making and shipping your nails right to you, and maybe you don't want to wait. Whether you want them now, or maybe you just want to express your own creativity, you 
                can make your own press-on nails, skipping the middle man altogether. Now you'll save time AND money; win-win!
            </p>

            <p><strong>Here's what you'll need to get started:</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li>Press-On Nail Stand with ten (10) Tips</li>
                <li>Putty Adhesive</li>
                <li>Nail File</li>
                <li>Cuticle Pushers and Cutters</li>
                <li>Cuticle Oil</li>
                <li>100% Acetone</li>
                <li>Press-On Nails in Preferred Shape and Size</li>
                <li>Nail Glue or Tabs</li>
                <li>Nail Base Foundation (regular or gel polish, acyrlic, or dip powder)</li>
                <li>If using gel polish, you'll need a UV curing lamp</li>
                <li>Decorations you want to put on your nails</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Once you have all your gathered materials, follow these directions and you'll be ready to show off your new manicure in no time!</strong></p>

            <ol>
                <li>First things first, you'll need to make sure you get the correct size nail for each finger. Thankfully, doing this is fairly easy. You'll notice that 
                    most, if not all, press-on nails come with a number on the bottom of each nail. Line the nail up with flush with your cuticle making sure that it's not flooding 
                    out to your skin or showing your real neal underneath. Do this for <ins>all ten (10)</ins> of your fingers, making sure to write down each finger and matching number for later use. 
                </li>

                <li>Once you've got all your nails matched up, you'll set up your press-on stand by placing a small tab of putty on each nail tip. Then take each press-on nail and place them 
                    on a tip from thumb to pinky, making two rows for each hand. 
                </li>

                <li>
                    <em>Now it's time to decorate!</em> You can use whichever base you've chosen, making sure to cure after each layer if you've opted for gel, and add whatever designs or decorations you want. 
                    When you're all finished, put them to the side to allow them time to properly dry.
                </li>

                <li>Next, you'll want to use the cuticle pusher and cutters to get rid of any outgrown cuticles on the nail bed so that you have a clean surface. Use the pusher to loosen the 
                    extra skin and cuticle, and use the cutter to carefully clip it off. Be very careful doing this step, it can be really easily to accidently knick your nail bed.
                </li>

                <li>Now you'll want to use the nail file to gently buff your nails. This will give whatever adhesive you're using, be it glue or tabs, something to grip on. A smooth surface is more likely to 
                    result in your nails popping off, and we don't want that. Wash your hands to remove any dust, and then wipe each nail with a tissue soaked in acetone to remove any excess water or natural oil 
                    on your nails. The dryer, the better. 
                </li>

                <li>
                    <em>Now, it's time for application!</em> Nail tabs are optimal if you only want your nails on for a few days or hours, and nail glue works best if you want them to last for weeks. Tabs can easily be pulled off, 
                    and excess glue can be filed off with a simple nail file. With proper maitenance, both methods should result in little to no nail damage to your natural nails. Some people opt to wear both, placing the tab 
                    on their natural nail and gluing the nail to the tab so the glue doesn't have to be on the natural nail and, if done correctly, these can last for weeks, as well. It should be noted that nail tabs can be a bit 
                    on the thicker side, so sometimes the press-on nail may be slightly higher than the natural nail bed. Nail tabs also come in different sizes like press-ons, so you'll want to make sure you select the proper size for each nail.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Whichever application you choose, it's best to have your nails ready to put on immediately. Remove them from the stand tips, making sure no putty is on the bottom, and line them up in front of you 
                    in two rows. If you've chosen to do tabs, you can place all five on your finger nails. Then take each nail and press it on top of the tab, holding firm for at least <ins>ten (10) to twenty (20) seconds</ins>
                    to make sure it's secure. Repeat for the other hand. If you choose to do nail glue, add a drop of glue to the center of your finger, then press the nail on your finger and hold for at least <ins> ten (10) to twenty (20) seconds </ins>
                    to make sure it's secure. It's best to do this method one nail at a time so that the glue doesn't dry up or run. 
                </li>

                <li>
                    Once all your nails are placed on, apply cuticle oil to your nail beds and rub in. Don't use your nails to open any objects and keep your hands out of water for at least <ins>one (1) hour</ins> to ensure your nail adhesives are fully 
                    dried and secure. <em>Enjoy your new manicure!</em>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                <strong>Removing your press on nails is just as easy.</strong> As mentioned before, if you decide to use nail tabs, you can simply place your finger under the false nail and pop them off. They will come off with very little force and you can resuse 
                them later if you want. If you decided to use nail glue, it will require a bit more effort. There are two methods you can use, one which will allow you to save your press-ons, and one that won't. 
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    If you want to save your press-ons, you'll want to mix some warm water with some cuticle oil and soack your fingers for <ins>thirty (30) minutes to an hour</ins>. At this point, your nails should loosen around the edges
                    and you should be able to get a pointed nail file under them to gently pop your nails off. You can then dry the nails, file any excess nail glue off the back, and save them for later use. This method also works if you 
                    want to throw your nails away but don't want to damage your natural nails and have extra time. File the excess glue off your natural nails, apply some cuticle oil, and your nails will look good as new.
                </li>

                <li>
                    If you don't want to save your nails or are in a rush, fill a bowl with acetone and soak your fingers for about <ins> ten (10) to fifteen (15) minutes</ins>. At this point, the nails will appear to be melting or falling apart and 
                    you should be able to remove them from your natural nails with ease. You won't be able to save these nails, and the acetone may dry out your natural nails a bit. Apply some cuticle oil and allow your nails some time 
                    to rejuvenate before applying a new set.
                </li>
            </ul>
